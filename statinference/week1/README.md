### [Introduction]

### Probability

- notations
  - the sample space is the collection of possible outcomes of an experiment
  - an event is a subset of the sample space
  - an elementary or simple event is a particular result of an experiment
  - null event is an empty set

- set operations

- probability
  - a probability measure, P, is a function from the collection of possible events

### Random variables, densities and pmfs
  
- **Random variable**: a numerical outcome of an experiment
  - two varieties: discrete or continuous
    - discrete random variables
	- continuous random variables

- **PMF**: probability mass functions
  - a probability mass function evaluated at a value corresponding to the probability that a random variable takes that value
  1. $p(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
  2. $\sum_{x} p(x) = 1$

- **PDF**: probability density functions
  - a probability density function is a function associated with a continuous random variable
  - areas under pdfs correspond to probability for that random variable
  1. $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
  2. The area under $f(x)$ is one.
