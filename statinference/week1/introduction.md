### Introduction, motivating examples

> Statistical inference is the process of drawing formal conclusions from data.

- estimation
  - estimator
  - estimand

- motivating example
  - who will win the election?
  - is hormone replacement therapy effective?

- goals of inference
  - estimate and quantify the uncertainty of an estimate of a population quantity (the proportion of people who will vote for a candidate)
  - determine wheter a population quantity is a benchmark value ("is the treatment effective?")
  - infer a mechanistic relationship when quantities are measured with noise ("what is the slope for Hooke's law?)
  - deteremine the impact of a policy ("if we reduce polution levels, will asthema rate decline?")

- tools
  - randomization: concerned with balancing unobserved variables
  - random sampling: concerned with obtaining data that is representative of population
  - sampling models: concerned with creating a model for the sampling process, the most common is so called "iid"
  - hypothesis testing: concerned with decision making in the presense of uncertainty
  - confidence intevals: concerned with quantifying uncertainty in estimation
  - probability models: a formal connection between the data and a population of interest
  - study design: the process of desigining an experiment to minimize bias and uncertainty
  - nonparametric bootstraping: the process of using data to create inferences with minimal probability model (data-oriented)
  - permutations, randomization, and exchangeability testing: the process of using data permutations to perform inferences (data-oriented)
  
- styles
  - frequency probability: is the long run proportion of times an event occurs in iid repetitions
  - frequency inference: use frequency interpretation of probabilities to control error rates
  - bayesian probability: is the probability calculus of beliefs, given that beliefs follow certain rules
  - bayesian inference: the use of bayesian probability representation of beliefs to perform inference

- this class
  - focus on sampling models, basic probability models and frequency style analysis to create standard inferences
  - consider some inferential strategies that rely heavily on observed data, such as permutation testing and bootstraping
  - start with basic probability
  
- topics not covered
  - explicit use of random sampling in inferences: "finite population statistics", in polling and sample surveys
  - explicit use of randomization in inferences: "causal inference, in clinical trials
  - bayesian probability and bayesian statistics
  - missing data: "multiple imputation", in biostatistics and economic references
  - study design
