Subsetting
==========

- `[`: returns an object of the same class, can be used to select more than one element
- `[[`: used to extract elements of a list or a data frame; it can only be used to extrat a single element and the class of the returned object will not necessarily be a list or data frame
- `$`: used to extract elemetns of a list or data frame by name; semantics are similar to that of `[[`

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
x[1]
x[1:4]
x[x > "a"]
u <- x > "a"
u
x[u] # select elments that are larger than "a"
```

#### subsetting a matrix

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x[1, 2] # returns a vector of length 1 rather than a 1x1 matrix
x[1, 2, drop=FALSE] # returns a 1x1 matrix

x[, 2] # omit indices
x[1, ] # returns a vector
x[1, , drop=FALSE] # returns a matrix
```

- `drop=FALSE`: returns a matrix rather than a vector
