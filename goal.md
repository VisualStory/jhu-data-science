My Goal to reach after finishing the courses
============================================

To begin with, I will not pay $490 for the spcialization, so it's fully on my own willing to study the courses. For me, taking the course is not only about the certificate, but also the skill that allow me to manipulate data and get true value from it.

Data science is a sexy subject at the emerging of big data idea, and it is a complicated, multi-displine area that requires both breath and depth in technologies to discover knowledge from raw data. In order to gain the skill sets, one must start from the study of tools and then analysis methodologies. 

The syllabus of specialization gives the full ingredient of the delicious pizza:

* The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox
* R Programming
* Getting and Cleaning Data
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Reproducible Research
* Statistical Inference
* Regression Models
* Practical Machine Learning
* Developing Data Products

The comprehensive course lists suit the requirement to learn the whole process of data science. In addition to machine learning which mainly discusses statistics like classification and regression, data science has a large emphasis on development of data products, which is more likely a computer science effort. This makes data science not merely a study of data, but as powerful tools as any software used in any large clusters or supercomputers.

I am eager to become an data expert, or data scientist, by learning the courses and do the hands-on assignments/projects to get some real tastes of the game. In the end I'm expected to get familiar with:

* Tools
  * R programming (Analytics)
  * R plotting (Visualiziation)
* Statistics
  * Regression 
  * Bayesian
  
I'm expected to take three courses at a time, and finish all of them in July. I also plan to write summary notes for each of them as well as all of them as a whole.

God bless me.
